/** The Harrison Group Life Insurance company computes annual policy premiums based on the age the customer turns in the current calendar year. The premium
*is computed by taking the decade of the customerâ€™s age, adding 15 to it, and multiplying by 20. For example, a 34-year-old would pay $360, which is calculated
*by adding the decades (3) to 15, and then multiplying by 20. Write an application that prompts a user for the current year and a birth year. 
*Pass both to a method that calculates and returns the premium amount, and then display the returned amount. Save the application as Insurance.java.*/
